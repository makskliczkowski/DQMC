# DQMC
This is the repository for the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for Hubbard-like Hamiltonians. The code is still in progress following the purpose of solving much broader types of interactions. Ultimately, as the code will progress, the plausable solution to various condensed matter models is sought for the reasearch on them to be done. 

# Quickstart
The code involves a great number of square matrix multiplications. In order to maintain a high level of commands, the [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) library has been involved. The code structure uses polymorphism to expand general model class, based a on general lattice, to potentially include more types of interaction in the Hamiltonians. To specifically run the code in a mode choosen by the user, the parser has been created, which includes both file and command line reading in a Unix-like style. In the src/ and include/ folders the header files are placed.
