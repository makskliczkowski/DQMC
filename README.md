# DQMC
This is the repository for the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for Hubbard-like Hamiltonians. The code is still in progress following the purpose of solving much broader types of interactions. Ultimately, as the code will progress, the plausable solution to various condensed matter models is sought for the reasearch on them to be done.
